Here's a simplified version of the library management question that only focuses on **attributes and methods** without discussing OOP principles like polymorphism, inheritance, etc.:

### Scenario-Based Question:

You are designing a system for a library to manage its items. The library deals with three types of items: **Books**, **Magazines**, and **DVDs**. Each type of item has the following attributes:

1. **Books**:  
   - `title` (string)  
   - `author` (string)  
   - `ISBN` (string)  
   - `publisher` (string)  
   - `publicationDate` (string)  

2. **Magazines**:  
   - `title` (string)  
   - `publisher` (string)  
   - `issueNumber` (integer)  
   - `publicationDate` (string)  

3. **DVDs**:  
   - `title` (string)  
   - `director` (string)  
   - `duration` (integer in minutes)  
   - `publisher` (string)  
   - `releaseDate` (string)  

The library should provide the following methods:
1. **Add Item**: Add a new item to the library's collection.
2. **Search Item by Title**: Return the details of all items that match a given title.
3. **Search Item by Publisher**: Return the details of all items that match a given publisher.
4. **Display All Items**: Display the details of every item in the library's collection.

### Task:
1. Define the attributes and methods needed to implement the library management system.
2. Write a basic implementation (in pseudocode or code) to handle adding items, searching by title, and searching by publisher.

This approach keeps it focused on attributes and methods without directly discussing advanced OOP principles.
